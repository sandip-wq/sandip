              Hey! I&apos;m Sandip, a Media Informatics student at HTW Berlin
              with a passion for web development and programming. I specialize
              in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
              I&apos;m diving deeper into Java and modern frameworks like React and NextJS.

            <p className={styles.aboutText}>
              I&apos;ve worked on projects like creating responsive educational
              websites, building career-focused applications, and collaborating
              on team projects that combine innovative technologies. I&apos;m
              currently part of a team building a career website for
              Berlin&apos;s fire department using Next.js and TailwindCSS.

              Outside of coding, I enjoy volunteering and giving back to the
              community. Recently, I worked with refugees, helping them navigate
              their new environment and organize activities. These experiences
              taught me the value of teamwork and empathy.
